                    <h1> BELGIAN WAFFLES RECIPE  </h1> <br> <br>
					<h3> INGREDIENTS </h3> <br>
					<ul>
					    <li> 1 ¾ cups Whole milk </li>
                        <li>2 ½ teaspoon Dry yeast</li>
                        <li>2 ½ cup All-purpose flour (maida)</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
                        <li>½ cup Unsalted butter melted</li>
                        <li>2 large Eggs</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon Baking soda</li>
						<h4>For Serving:</h4>
                        <li>Maple Syrup or Honey</li>
                        <li>Fruits</li>
                        <li>Powdered Sugar for Serving</li>
					</ul>  <br> <br>
					<h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3> <br>
					<ul>
					    <li>Take flour, yeast, sugar, salt in a bowl. Add in milk, melted butter and mix really well. Cover and leave it to ferment overnight.
						    I like to prepare the batter right before going to bed and make the waffles in the morning. 
						    The batter has to ferment at least 8 hours. Use a large bowl for making the batter since it has yeast the batter will rise a lot.</li>
                        <li>In the morning right before you make the waffle add an egg and baking soda into the batter and mix it really well. 
						    The batter will get even fluffy and light.</li>
                        <li>Heat a waffle maker brush it generously with some melted butter or oil. Pour a ladle full of batter in the waffle maker, 
						    cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes till the waffles or crispy and golden.</li>
                        <li>Remove it from the waffle maker and serve hot with a drizzle of maple syrup or honey.</li>
					</ul>

                    <h1> CHOCOLATE BAR CAKE  </h1> <br> <br>
					<h3> INGREDIENTS </h3> <br>
					<ul>
					    <li>1 large Egg</li>
                        <li>1 cup Brown Sugar | Jaggery (200 grams)</li>
                        <li>½ cup Oil (120 ml)</li>
                        <li>½ cup Yogurt or Buttermilk (120 ml)</li>
                        <li>¼ cup Cocoa powder (50 grams)</li>
                        <li>1 cup All purpose flour (120 grams)</li>
                        <li>½ tsp Baking powder</li>
                        <li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
                        <li>½ tsp Salt</li>
                        <li>½ cup Hot Water (120 ml)</li>
                        <li>2 Bar Chocolate Bar</li>
				    </ul>  <br> <br>
					<h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3> <br>
					<ul>
					    <li>Preheat oven to 180 degree C. Line a square baking pan with parchment paper, making sure you have overhanging 
						    parchment paper on the sides of the pan for easy removal of the cake from the mould. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Take a bowl. Add in egg, brown sugar, oil, curd and mix well. The sugar has to be mixed well into the egg and buttermilk.</li>
                        <li>Add in cocoa, flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Mix gently until it is just combined. Don’t over mix.</li>
                        <li>Add in hot water and fold gently, The batter will be very runny. That is what gives you the moist cake.</li>
                        <li>Spoon into prepared baking pan and bake for 45 to 55 mins until tooth pick inserted comes clean.</li>
                        <li>Now remove cake from oven and let it cool for just 5 mins. Place bars of chocolate over hot cake so the chocolate
  						    melts slightly and sticks to the chocolate. let it cool completely.</li>
                        <li>Un mould cake and slice serve.</li>

				<p> <b>WELCOME!</b> <br><br>
                    I am so glad that you are here!... <br><br>
                    First let me introduce myself. My name is xyzxyz a food blogger, food photographer, recipe creator and youtuber.<br><br>
                    Yummiest Recipes was started around 9 years back. I started my blog as a tiny little space where i can share my recipes 
					with my friends and family. Later it turned into my career.<br>
                    I used to cook different foods for my friends at work. They started asking for the recipe.
					That was a turning point for me, So i decided to start my very own blog where i can share my recipes.
					My work was a research based one and it went pretty good, but i found that something was lacking in that. 
					I realized that this is not what i wanted to do in my life. After lot of thinking and discussion with my family. 
					I took a brave decision of quitting my job with my family's support.<br>
					Yes I quit my job to continue my passion. This blog was a tiny one before, but as days passed it received lot of 
					appreciation and my viewer count started increasing. I spent most of my time blogging. I cooked lot of food recipes and uploaded 
					it in my blog daily. As years passed Yummiest Recipes has become a part of my life.<br><br>
